# alexa-skill-river-trivia

I have built River Trivia Alexa skill.

1) Skill Objective – It is very difficult to remember details of river like name, length, source of origin etc. But it’s also important to remember as a part of general knowledge. So though and built Alexa skill to solve this pain area of remembering river information and to help user to understand and remember river facts. 
2) Skill Category – Education, Trivia 
3) Target Audience for the skill you plan on building for Alexa Skills Hackathon - Those who wants to get details of river and also want to play trivia of river facts. 
4) Brief Description of the Idea for the Skill - This skill is useful to all user who wants to know details of Indian rivers. This Alexa skill would tell 5 random facts about river. Alexa would also ask few questions based on told facts to understand the level of understanding of user and then AI powered algorithm would throw river facts in future sessions as per users level of understanding. 
River facts could be source of mouth, length, states river flowing through and many more. 
This would help students to prepare for exam. This would also help others to enhance general knowledge of rivers. There would be 2 modes in this Alexa skilll, one mode would be learning mode and another would be quiz/trivia mode.
